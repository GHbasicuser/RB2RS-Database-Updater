# RB2RS-Database-Importer
This VBS Script download and install the latest "unofficial" list of radio stations for RadioSure.

This list of stations is a conversion of the "Radio-Browser.info" database.

eg: C:\Windows\System32\WScript.exe C:\Program Files (x86)\RadioSure\db-update.vbs

(Don't forget to configure “Start in” part with RadioSure folder.)
